.Sh DESCRIPTION          
.Nm
is a simple commandline package manager that installs AppImages and
precompiled tar archives. Using the lists generated from spm's repo, spm
provides a variety of AppImages and precompiled tars for install. spm keeps
track of installed packages and their versions, so spm can also be used to
upgrade and remove packages installed by spm.

.Sh APPIMAGES                
AppImages are installed to '/usr/local/bin/AppImageName'. Information for installed AppImages is stored in '/home/simonizor/.config/spm/appimginstalled/AppImageName'.  Packages on your system should not conflict with AppImages
installed through
.Nm
, but
.Nm
will not allow AppImages that have the same name as existing commands on
your system to be installed.

AppImages contain all dependencies that are necessary for the app to run as long as
those dependencies would not be on a normal Linux system.  This means that AppImages should "just work"
without having to install any additional packages!

Upgrades for AppImages that are downloaded from direct sources rather than Github will not be reliable.  There is no reliable way to check versions for AppImages from direct sources.  If you find an AppImage from a direct source to be out of date even after running the update argument, try running the force update argument.  If the AppImage is still out of date, please report an issue on spm's github repo.

.Sh TAR ARCHIVES
Precompiled tar archives are installed to '/opt/PackageName', and symlinks are created for the .desktop and executable
files. Information for installed tar archives is stored in '/home/simonizor/.config/spm/tarinstalled/PackageName'.


.Nm
does not handle installing dependencies for tar packages that are installed through spm. A list of dependencies
will be outputted on install and will also be saved to '/home/simonizor/.config/spm/tarinstalled/PackageName'. If you find that
you are missing dependencies needed for a package installed through
.Nm
, you can look there for some help.
