# Create a script that wraps useful apt, Ubuntu package managing related, and spm commands into one easy to use, elegant script.
# Make this script easily interact with one or both at the same time.
# Possibly use this as a base to somehow provide a list of debs that aren't in Ubuntu's repos and manage them?
# Make this script intelligent enough to only show and work with commands that are relevant to spm if spm is installed.
# Make this script not work at all on non Ubuntu based distros.
# Create it in a manner that is well commented and easy to follow so other users could modify this to work with other distros.
